    <h3>Is there a sight more iconic, more beautiful, more jaw-droppingly spectacular than the Taj<br> Mahal?</h3></section>
    <section style="font-size: 18px; margin-left: 330px; color: rgb(100, 95, 95); word-spacing: 2.2px; line-height: 30px;">
    <p>Quite honestly, we can’t think of one.</p>
    <p >At the very least, there’s no mausoleum more grand, no declaration of love more apparent than<br> building a marble masterpiece for one’s favorite wife… And no better reason to travel than seeing <br>its magnificence up close.</p>
    <p >After all, this is art. Built in Agra,<a href="#" style="color:rgb(155, 37, 37);"> India</a> between 1631 and 1648, it’s also history. And, of course, it’s <br>
        the perfect opportunity to take some otherworldly photos. So, to help visitors prepare for their Taj <br>
         Mahal travels, we’ve prepared a little guide, enlisting the help of some Intrepid experts – from <br>
         Destination Managers to acclaimed trip leaders – to cover all the bases. <br><br> Coming up: what to bring, where to take the best snaps, what else to see in Agra (and beyond),
         <br> and so much more…</p>
     <h3>Before you arrive at the Taj Mahal</h3>
     <p>That old saying ‘patience is a virtue’ really comes into its own when discussing the Taj Mahal.<br>
        Be prepared to be surrounded by hundreds (if not thousands) of people. These include Indian<br> men, women and children who may ask to take photos with you.<br><br>
        To prepare with the help of other travelers and a local tour guide, consider taking a group tour.<br> Intrepid have Taj-visiting trips that range from <a href="#" style="color:rgb(155, 37, 37);"></a>8-day Golden Triangle tours</a> (now with <a href="#" style="color:rgb(155, 37, 37);">solo-only<br>
         departures!)</a> to <a href="#" style="color:rgb(155, 37, 37);">15-day trips dedicated to food,</a> to 19-day trips combining the <a href="#" style="color:rgb(155, 37, 37);"> highlights of India<br> and Nepal.</a><br><br>
        If you’re more pressed for time, you can check out the Taj Mahal on a whirlwind day tour from <br>
        Delhi. Check out Urban Adventures to see the itinerary that we’d recommend for this. And while <br>
        you’re at it, check out their day trips in <a href="#" style="color:rgb(155, 37, 37);"> Delhi, Jaipur,</a>Varanasi and Mumbai!</p>

    <p>The entrance queue can be pretty long during peak season but as long as you’re mentally<br>
         prepared, you’ll be fine. What’s to come is more than worth the wait…</p>
         <h4>What to bring to the Taj Mahal</h4>
         <p>Always leave your valuables in the hotel. There are lockers available at the Taj but it’s best to have<br>
             minimal belongings on you so you don’t spend too much time checking in.<br><br>

            You really only need to bring the following in one small bag:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Passport</li>
                <li>Money</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Medicine</li>
                <li>Camera</li>
                <li>Phone</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>What to wear to the Taj Mahal</h4>
            <p>There is no dress code but you should still be respectful. If you want to enter the mosque, you will <br> need to cover your head, shoulders and knees.<br><br>

                It gets hot in Agra and there is very little shade, so wear light clothing and make sure you wear
                <br> sunscreen. Then again, Agra also gets very cold in winter (Nov-Feb) so layers are your friend too.<br><br>
                
                If you visit with Intrepid, you’ll be taken there earlier in the day or later in the afternoon to avoid <br>
                 the worst of the heat.</p>

            <p>Useful tip from Ryan Turner, Intrepid’s Destination Manager for India:<br><br>
                Having been to the Taj a few times, I’ve learnt the importance of wearing shoes that are<br>
                 easy to remove. You need to take your shoes off when you go inside and the easier they are<br>
                 to slip on and off the better. This actually applies to much of India – shoes with loads of <br>
                 laces are hard!</p>
                 <h4>Other things you need to know</h4>

                 <p>No food is allowed inside.<br><br>

                    Cigarettes and lighters are also not allowed.<br><br>
                    
                    Tripods and additional lighting equipment need prior permission to be brought with.<br>
                     Photography inside the mausoleum is prohibited. Most electronics (except cameras and small<br>
                      video cameras) are not allowed.<br><br>
                    
                    Be wary of touts, thieves and rude shop keepers. It’s a busy, high-pressure area, but keep your<br>
                     wits about you and you won’t need to worry!</p>

                     <h3>When you’re at the Taj Mahal</h3>
                     <p>Go early, wait for space to explore and photograph, and get yourself away from the crowds (if<br> possible).</p>
                     <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/India_Agra_taj_mahal_crowds_185.jpg" alt="pic2">
                     <p>
                        If you walk around to the right side of the Taj (as you approach the east gate), you can get an<br>
                         amazing photo from the riverbank behind the Taj. (Always go in groups and get a rickshaw to<br>
                          take you there and back cheaply.)<br><br>

                        And simply focus on taking in all the magic. Even Intrepid leaders who see the Taj Mahal monthly<br>
                         (or more!) remain in awe of it. Sana Jinah, one of the company’s inspiring female tour guides, has<br>
                          some tips on how to do this:<br></p>
                          <p style="color: grey;">"The Taj Mahal is a place for exploring quietly on your own or with loved ones. So, once I’m<br>
                           done briefing my groups I give them a good 2-3 hours inside the Taj. There are ways I try to <br>
                           make the experience special and memorable for travelers, but if I say what they are then<br>
                            they will no longer be surprises!<br>   
                          The Taj has such a charm. Every time I see it it looks different (due to the direction of the sunlight).<br>
                           It’s so beautiful…
                     </p>
                    <p>
                        She also recommends those looking for optimum conditions try visiting the Taj Mahal at sunrise<br>
                         on a clear day.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Tips for taking photos at the Taj Mahal</h3>
                    <p>Everyone wants that iconic shot of themselves at the Taj Mahal. You know the one – where you sit<br>
                         on the bench and the grandeur of the marble mausoleum forms the backdrop.
                     </p>
                     <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/india_agra_taj-mahal_taking-in-the-surroundings.jpg" alt="pic2">
                     <p>But if you’re feeling creative and want to mix things up, there are tons of different angles worth<br>
                         seeking out.<br><br>
                         Below are some photography suggestions from Intrepid’s General Manager in India,<a href="#" style="color:rgb(155, 37, 37);">Pravin <br>
                          Tamang.</a> (His photography is amazing – <a href="#" style="color:rgb(155, 37, 37);"> check it out!) </a>  </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Shot from the arch of the main doorway</li>
                            <li>Capture the reflection of the fountains that line the route towards the Taj Mahal’s main<br> platform</li>
                            <li>Shot of Taj Mahal from the riverside with the reflection on the river</li>
                            <li>Shot from the other side of the river, ‘Mehtab Bagh’, where you get a glimpse of Taj</li>
                            <li>The Taj Mahal can also be shot from some parts of the Red Fort</li>
                          </ul>

                          <p>
                            You can also get great photos from the many rooftops of restaurants close to the Taj Mahal. <br>
                            Unfortunately, Agra does get pretty smoggy, so winter can often have poor visibility earlier in the<br>
                             day and around sunset. That said, this can make shots look very atmospheric!
                          </p>

                          <h4>What to do after visiting the Taj Mahal</h4>
                          <p>First, go back to your hotel room, take a shower, and revel in the relative peace and quiet. Then <br>
                            explore these cool destinations both in and out of Agra:</p>
                            <h4>What to do in Agra</h4>
                            <p>The Taj Mahal is, quite clearly, the star of the show in this northern Indian city. But the Agra Fort is<br>
                                 also stunning, especially if you didn’t get a chance to go to the Red Fort in Delhi. A 16th-century <br>
                                 Mughal monument and UNESCO World Heritage site, it’s a sight not to be missed.<br>
                                 Despite being located on the <a href="#" style="color:rgb(155, 37, 37);"> Golden Triangle</a> tourist circuit, there’s less to do in Agra than in<br>
                                  many other Indian cities. It’s pretty polluted from the heavy industry (more on that later) and you <br>
                                  likely won’t spend too long there, whatever the trip.<br><br>
                                  One way that Intrepid tries to show visitors a different perspective on the country is by <br>
                                  (sometimes) taking travelers to Sheroes Hangout. Just blocks from the Taj Mahal, it’s a small cafe<br>
                                   run entirely by female acid attack survivors. Here, victims of attacks are employed and tell their<br>
                                    stories. It can be confronting, but also inspiring and memorable in equal measures.
                                </p>
                                <a href="#" style="color:rgb(155, 37, 37);"><h5 style="text-align: center; margin-right: 400px;" >SUBSCRIBE TO INTREPID’S NEWSLETTER FOR MORE TRAVEL GUIDES, COMPETITIONS, <br>GIVEAWAYS & MORE</h5></a>
                                <h5>Where to go outside of Agra</h5>
                                <p>There are various great destinations only a few hours drive (well, 4-7) from the Taj Mahal. Of these, <br>
                                    Orchha, Jaipur and Pushkar are all tourist-friendly, peaceful and beautiful places.<br><br>

                                    Orchha is a town that travelers often overlook. This is a shame, because it’s historic, laid-back<br>
                                     and has a bunch of beautiful temples. It’s not always on tour itineraries, but you CAN visit<br>
                                      it on this 15-day trip from Delhi to Kathmandu (cooking demo and palace visit included!).</p>
                            <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/india_orchha_temple.jpg" alt="pic5">
                            <p style="margin-left: 250px; margin-top: 5px; color: rgb(140, 125, 125);">Chaturbhuj Temple in Orchha</p>
                            <p>Jaipur is much more well-known. Also known as the<a href="#" style="color:rgb(155, 37, 37);"> ‘Pink City’</a>, the capital of Rajasthan is full of <br>
                                chaos, charm and unique architecture. Visit the hilltop Amber Fort, haggle in the enchanting<br>
                                 bazaars, and consider taking a hot air balloon over the city to take it all in.<br><br>

                                Pushkar is another underrated town. One of the oldest and most serene towns in India, it’s home<br>
                                 to Pushkar Lake, a sacred spot for Hindus that’s utterly dazzling at sundown. Because of its holy<br>
                                  nature, the vegetarian food here is simply unmissable. Visit on <a href="#" style="color:rgb(155, 37, 37);">this 15-day trip</a> all around <br>
                                  Rajasthan.</p>
                                  <h4>A final note about the Taj Mahal’s mud therapy</h4>
                                  <p>
                                    As you may have read or heard, the Taj Mahal has recently been undergoing a very thorough <br>
                                    clean. Yep, to be precise, a mud mask as of April 2018.<br><br>

                                   Why? Air pollution from factories in Agra had been slowly turning the Taj Mahal’s ivory-white<br>
                                    surfaces yellow – and this was one way of restoring them to their former glory. The work – <br>
                                    applying a clay traditionally used to clean marble to the entire structure of the Taj – was carried<br>
                                     out by the Archaeological Survey of India. And this work was part of a series of restorative projects <br>
                                     carried out on the historic site.
                                  </p>
